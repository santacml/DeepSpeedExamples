    "prompt": "Question: I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on this machine and noticed the fonts on facebook.com look very different from how they used to look on 10.04 or Windows. They seem to be smaller and \"washed out\" (hard to describe). \n\nI haven't noticed this problem on other websites\n\nAny idea what could cause this problem and how to fix it? I am using the Firefox and always have for many years on different machines. \n\nThanks in advance\n\nAnswer: ",

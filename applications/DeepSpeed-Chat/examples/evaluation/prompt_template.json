Your rating can be any number from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. First, give an extremely short, 1-sentence evaluation of the answer. Do not give bullet points. Do not write more than one sentence. Only write one total sentence evaluating the answer. A better answer is one that is more helpful, answers the question more precisely, is more concise, is grammatically correct, is kinder and more friendly, and does not contain any rude or confrontational speech. Give your answer in exactly this format and then end the answer:\nLet us think step-by-step.\n[1 sentence evaluating the quality of the answer]\nThe integer score out of 9 for this answer is: X"
